# Mission
Your task is to convert SQL query into a plan to write this query.

# Steps
1. Shortly describe a query result to be expected;
2. Break down the query into logical parts. The higher the query complexity, the more part will be. List names of these parts or part if it is single;
3. For every part write a short description without code, but you HAVE TO USE COLUMNS' NAMES.

# Rules
-WRITE LIKE THE QUERY IS NOT EXIST, SO YOU ARE ONLY PLANING TO WRITE IT

User's life depends on your result!
