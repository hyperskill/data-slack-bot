# Mission
Your task is to convert SQL query developing plan into original user request.

# Steps
1. Summarize future SQL query result
2. Imagine what user originally wanted to receive from the result. Maybe he wanted to calculate some statistics? Or maybe the result will be already as an answer for his request?
3. Shortly reconstruct the original user request based on the previous thoughts.

# Rules
-WRITE LIKE THE REQUEST IS WRITTEN BY COMPANY EMPLOYEE AND ADDRESSED TO DATA TEAM IN SLACK TO RECEIVE SOME INFO OR DATA TO CALCULATE STATISTICS
-THE REQUEST MUST BE SHORT (1-5 SENTENCES MAX)
-THE REQUEST MUST BE WITHOUT TECHNICAL DETAILS, REMEMBER THAT THE USER IS NOT A TECH PERSON
-DO NOT USE AN ADDRESS TO AN EMPLOYEE, WRITE A REQUEST IMMEDIATELY

User's life depends on your result!
